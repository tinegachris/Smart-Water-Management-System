## Abstract
The Smart Water Management System project aggregates three meters to enable remote and automatic real-time measurement of water consumption. Based on actionable decisions such as water leakage and consumption metrics, water supply through the pipes is controlled using solenoid valves. The consumer and the supplier can monitor, visualize consumption metrics and control the system through the designed android interface.

## Firmware Walkthrough

- **Libraries**


The ESP8266WiFi, ESP8266WebServer, ESP8266mDNS and the ThingSpeak libraries were included.

```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h> // ESP8266WiFi library
#include<ESP8266WebServer.h> // WebServer library
#include <ESP8266mDNS.h> // mDNS library
#include<ThingSpeak.h> // ThingSpeak library
```
- **Variables and Constants**

The variables and constants were defined as follows.
```
const int measuringInterval = 0.1 * 1000; // measure flow every 1 second
const int postingInterval = 15 * 1000; // post data every 15 seconds

long currentMillis = 0, previousMillis = 0;

float calibrationFactor_1 = 0.1;
volatile byte pulseCount_1;
byte pulse1Sec_1 = 0;
float flowRate_1;
unsigned long flowMilliLitres_1, totalMilliLitres_1;
float flowLitres_1, totalLitres_1;

// Control solenoid valve
const int controlChannelID = XXXXXXX; //ThingSpeak channel used for control
unsigned int valve1 = 4;
```

- **Wi-Fi Settings**

The SSID and password are set to allow the NodeMCU to connect to a network
```
const char* ssid = "mySSID"; // wireless network name (SSID)
const char* password = "myPassword"; // Wi-Fi network password
```

- **ThingSpeak Settings**

ThingSpeak credentials and API key are set to allow sending data to specific channel.
```
// ThingSpeak Settings
const int channelID = YYYYYYY;
String writeAPIKey = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
const char* server = "api.thingspeak.com";
```

- **Serial Communication**

The baud rate for serial communication  set was to 115200.
```
  void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // Start the Serial communication
  delay(100);
```

- **Define pins and initialize variables**

```
  pulseCount_1 = 0;
  flowRate_1 = 0.0;
  flowMilliLitres_1 = 0;
  totalMilliLitres_1 = 0;
  
  pinMode(flowSensor_1, INPUT_PULLUP);  
  pinMode(relayValve_1, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(relayValve_1, 0);
```

- **Connect to Wi-Fi network**

The NodeMCU waits until it is connected to a network then sends the IP address, Netmask and Gateway to the serial monitor.
```
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);             // Connect to the WiFi network
  Serial.print("Connecting to ");
  Serial.print(ssid); Serial.println("...");

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) { // Wait for the Wi-Fi to connect
    delay(500);
  }
  
  Serial.println("WiFi connected!"); 
  // Send the IP address of the ESP8266 to serial monitor 
  Serial.print("IP address:\t");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP()); 
  // Send the Netmask of the ESP8266        
  Serial.print("Netmask:\t");
  Serial.println(WiFi.subnetMask());  
  // Send the Gateway of the ESP8266
  Serial.print("Gateway:\t");
  Serial.println(WiFi.gatewayIP());
```

- **Measure Wi-Fi Strength**

The Wi-Fi strength is measured and sent to the serial monitor.
```
// Measure Signal Strength (RSSI) of Wi-Fi connection
long rssi = WiFi.RSSI();
String strgth = String(rssi);
Serial.println("signal strength: " + strgth + "dB\n");
```

- **HTTP server**

The HTTP server that listens for HTTP request on port 80. The mDNS responder is also started to resolve IP address to a local domain name.
```
  // Create a webserver object that listens for HTTP request on port 80
  ESP8266WebServer server(80);

  // Start the mDNS responder for esp8266.local
  if (MDNS.begin("esp8266")) {              
  Serial.println("mDNS responder started");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Error setting up MDNS responder!");
  }

  server.begin(); // Actually start the server
  Serial.println("HTTP server started");
  
  //create interrupt and call a function when change is detected
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(flowSensor_1), pulseCounter_1, FALLING);

  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
```

- **FLow Sensor Interrrupt**

An interrupt and a call function is created to detect water flow when the falling edge of the pulse is received.
```
//create interrupt and call a function when change is detected
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(flowSensor_1), pulseCounter_1, FALLING);
```
The pulse count is incremented for every pulse that is detected.
```
void IRAM_ATTR pulseCounter_1(){
  pulseCount_1++;
}
```

- **Flowrate and Volume Calculation**

The flowrate and volume through the meter is measured and calculated after every measuring interval. The total volume is the cumulative volume in the entire measuring time.
```
currentMillis = millis();
  // calculate after every measuring interval
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis > measuringInterval) {
    
    pulse1Sec_1 = pulseCount_1;
    pulseCount_1 = 0;

     //calculate flow rate in litres per min
    flowRate_1 = ((1000.0 / (millis() - previousMillis)) * pulse1Sec_1) / calibrationFactor_1;
    previousMillis = millis();

    //flowrate in millilitres per second
    flowMilliLitres_1 = (flowRate_1 / 60) * 1000;

    //flowrate in litres per second
    flowLitres_1 = (flowRate_1 / 60);

    //add volume flowed in this second to cumulative totals
    totalMilliLitres_1 += flowMilliLitres_1;
    totalLitres_1 += flowLitres_1;

    // Print the flow rate 1 for this second in litres / minute
    Serial.print("Flow rate 1: ");
    Serial.print(flowMilliLitres_1);
    Serial.print(" mL/s\t");
    
    // Print the cumulative total of litres flowed through meter 1 since starting
    Serial.print("Volume through meter 1: ");
    Serial.print(totalMilliLitres_1);
    Serial.print(" mL\n");
//    Serial.println("Volume through meter 1: "); //Uncomment for volume in litres
//    Serial.print(totalLitres_1);
//    Serial.println(" L\n");
```

- **API request body**

The body of API request with consumption data are constructed waiting to be posted to ThingSpeak on specific fields.
```
      // Construct API request body
      String body = "field1=";
      body += String(float(flowRate_1));
      body += "&field2=";
      body += String(totalMilliLitres_1);
      body += "&field3=";
      body += strgth;
      body += "\r\n\r\n";
```

- **Post to ThingSpeak**

The API requests bodies are written to the corresponding fields on ThingSpeak on the specified channel. Feedback on if the data was sent successfully is sent to the serial monitor.
```
      client.print("POST /update HTTP/1.1\n");
      client.print("Host: api.thingspeak.com\n");
      client.print("Connection: close\n");
      client.print("X-THINGSPEAKAPIKEY: " + writeAPIKey + "\n");
      client.print("Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n");
      client.print("Content-Length: ");
      client.print(body.length());
      client.print("\n\n");
      client.print(body);
      client.print("\n\n");
      Serial.println("data sent\n");
```

- **Solenoid Valve Status**

The status of solenoid valve i.e. if it is open or closed is checked from the control feed and status sent to the serial monitor.
```
      //get the last data of the fields
      int valve_1 = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(controlChannelID, valve1);
    
      if(valve_1 == 1){
        digitalWrite(relayValve_1, 1); // Open solenoid valve
        Serial.println("Solenoid valve is Closed!\n");
        }
      else if(valve_1 == 0){
        digitalWrite(relayValve_1, 0); //Close solenoid valve
        Serial.println("Solenoid valve is Open!\n");
        }
```

- **Wait and Post Again**

```
    client.stop();
    
    Serial.print("Waiting ");
    Serial.print(postingInterval/1000);
    Serial.print(" seconds to post again...\n");
    
    // wait and then post again
    delay(postingInterval);
```
