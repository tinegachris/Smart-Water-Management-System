## Acknowledgement
I acknowledge the efforts of my project partner Mr Thoenes Kimani and my project supervisor Mr Samson N. Njoroge, for ensuring this project was successful. Many thanks to all our friends and family for the encouragement and support throughout the period.

## Abstract
The Smart Water Management System project aggregates three meters to enable remote and automatic real-time measurement of water consumption. Based on actionable decisions such as water leakage and consumption metrics, water supply through the pipes is controlled using solenoid valves. The consumer and the supplier can monitor, visualize consumption metrics and control the system through the designed android interface.

## System Overview
The system consists of four functional modules, namely: the physical device, the gateway through which the device communicates with the backend service, the backend that allows storage of data, analysis, data access and notifications and the interface that allows visualization and control.

## Schematic Diagram
The schematic diagram of the system was designed using Autodesk's Eagle EDA software illustrating how the various components are interconnected. Custom libraries for the solenoid valve and the water flow sensor were created.
